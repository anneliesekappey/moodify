MOODIFY 

Moodify it's here to modify your mood, hence why we called it that. Through media, we hope to perk you up or help you cry, whichever you might need. 
 
Our inspiration to create this App was the fact that we like to send stuff to our friends when they're... well, whatever they may be. If they're sad, we want to help them through and if they're anything else, say happy, we want to support them and make that last as long as they have it in them. 

Think of Moodify as one step up from mixtapes and playlists, because Moodify lets you decide what you want. 

---HOW IT WORKS---

You can tell us how you feel, or you can answer a short quiz (ten questions) and we'll gauge your mood for you. After you've selected either option, you'll be asked if you want to change your current mood or have it matched. If you want to keep feeling what it is you are feeling, choose the option for the App to match your mood. If you want to feel something else - and who here has never wanted to feel something else - you can ask the App to change your mood. 

Once that selection has been made, you will see a list of three songs and a few movies too (usually three as well). At first you will see the song title and who is best known for it (considering composers, covers, etc.). With songs/pieces of music you will also see a short description. This description is meant to be something between cheeky and poetic. With movies, you will see the title and the creator/director. If anything catches your eye from this list, simply click on your favorite medium and you will be taken to a page with more details about this medium. There you'll have an image as well as a link to the real deal outside our App. Go and enjoy it! :) 

We truly hope that we may be an invisible friend if you find yourself wanting the soothing graces of what seems to be the most consumed art forms these days: music and movies. We hope that we may help you or just entertain you - whichever. 

Please feel free to let us know if you like the App, or if you don't. If you don't, please include why you don't - we just want to know so we can keep on improving it. 

Thank you for reading this. Have fun! :)
